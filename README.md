Scanned films database UI

User should be able to:
---
* upload scanned photos
* group photos by films 
* use photos deployed somewhere else (Google Photo, Flickr, etc)
* add comments to separate photos
* add comments to films
* set filming location for separate photos and whole films with different precesion (somewhere in Moscow, somewhere in Egypt, etc)
* set filming dates with different precision (approx decade, approx year, approx date, etc)

Would be nice to have:
---
* persons identification and search
* keep persons database
* other objects identification and search (find all cats for example)
